For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles.'),\n",

Controlling and regulating these interac- tions is at the core of formulation development. In terms of medical formulations, controlling PPIs is key to preventing protein degradation and aggregation, which in turn is believed to increase bioavailability. For many decades, amino acids (AAs) have been widely used to stabi- lize biological formulations, yet despite such widespread use, we are far from understanding the nature of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions. We do not even know if it is a specific biological effect as opposed to being a generic colloidal property. There have been many proposed mechanisms to explain these broad stabilization properties.

Other mechanisms involve AA strong effects on the water H-bonding structure3. In biologi- cal systems, the role of AAs in the cytosol of cells has been a topic of investigation for years. It was reported that almost all water-stressed organisms reduce the aggregation of proteins in cells by raising the concentration of AAs such as proline and glutamic acid6. For example, Escherichia coli regulates cytosolic proline concentration to inhibit the initial aggregation process of cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins7.'),\n",

An increase in B22 implies a more stable dispersion because it indicates a stronger repulsion among colloids. Conversely, a decrease in B22 indicates that attractive forces are becoming more dominant and may lead to destabilization of the dispersion. Adding salt typically destabilizes suspensions, as measured by a decrease in B22. However, in all cases, when we added AAs to dispersions of nanoscale colloids, we found an increase in B22, indicating more stable dispersions. Changes in B22 were detected at concentrations as low as 10\\u2009mM with no concentra- tion threshold and at protein to AAs stoichiometric ratios as low as 1:7.

This model is analogous to the DLVO theory. The increase in B22 can be obtained by screening the short- or long-range attraction, which, in turn, increases the effect of repulsive forces. The latter, longer-range attractive term is important in the case of polarizable gold nanoparticles.

More generally, we should evaluate the second virial as r, where U is the pair interaction potential. It is important to note that in the model we are studying, the attractive interaction parametrized by χ is assumed to be a contact interaction of very short range, that is, a contact inter- action occurring only on contact with the particles, and this gives rise to the interacting part scaling with a3. This is a good approximation in the limit that the interactions are short ranged, which we believe applies to proteins under biological conditions.

The adsorption is transient, but it equilibrates rapidly because the barriers to adsorb and desorb are small, and the diffusion constant of the AAs is large compared with that of the proteins themselves37,38.

Starting from a single crystal structure confines the ensemble of accessible protein conformations, so high-affinity adsorption sites that require a rare conformational opening may remain unsampled. Furthermore, HSQC NMR cannot resolve every backbone amide, leaving some adsorption sites invisible to the experiment, and some chemical shift perturbations may be caused by changes in hydration or conformation rather than direct amino acid contact.\\n\\njAA,'),\n",
